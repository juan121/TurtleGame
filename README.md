# TurtleGame

To play this game you should follow the instructions on CMD. Basically you must specicy two files, the gameSettings and the moves to perform by the turtle.

I have included sample files ( Turtle_MineHit, Turtle_OutOfBOunds,Turtle_StillInDanger,Turtle_Success) for every case scenario that may serve as guidance for format required and ease of execution. It does follow the order of the instructions provided.

I haven't added DI and IoC or Mocking frameworks as I haven't considered it necessary for this test and it can be considered as overengineering. However I'm happy to discuss about the approach if necessary and explain why I didn't implement them.

There is a variety of functionalities added , first to serve for the purpose of the game and then but not least, to show some important funcionality of .NET framework. These are aspects such as: 
- Extensions
- Generics
- Attributes and Reflection
- ReadOnly, Static and Constant keywords.
- Delegates and events.
- Current Thread manipulation.
- Inheritance through classes and interfaces and its implementation.
- Dictionary usage.
- Execeptionstreatment.
- Unit tests with a TDD aproach. It includes battery tests as well.
