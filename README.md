# TurtleGame

To play this game you should follow the instructions on CMD. Basically you must specicy two files, the gameSettings and the moves to perform by the turtle.

I have included sample files for every case scenario that may serve as guidance for format required. It does follow the order of instructions.

I haven't added DI and Ioc or Mocking frameworks as I haven't considered it necessary for this test, but I'm happy to discuss about the approach if necessary and why I didn't implement them.

There is a variety of functionalities added , first to serve for the purpose of the game and then but not least, to show some important funcionality of .NET framework. These are aspects such as: 
- Extensions
- Generics
- Attributes and Reflection
- ReadOnly, Static and Constant keywords.
- Delegates and events.
- Current Thread manipulation.
- Inheritance through classes and interfaces and its implementation.
- Dictionary usage.
- Execeptionstreatment.
- Unit tests with a TDD aproach. It includes battery tests as well.
